# Introduction
Hello world! This short book aims to serve as a short guide to productionising your Rust web applications on the backend. We'll cover things like caching, databases, deployments, rate limiting, security, and more.

## How to use this book
This mdbook aims to try and provide full understanding of the concepts we dive into such that when you implement them in your web applications, you'll be able to do so with idiomatic Rust and aims to take you from a "hobby project" to a fully production-ready service. 

Although you can start this book without being experienced in Rust, [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is highly recommended reading as it'll provide you with much more context on the basics.
